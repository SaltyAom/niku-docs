# Installation
Niku doesn't have any dependency, using native dart code, and doesn't use any code generation.
It's a straightforward way of composing classes and creating an extension.
Any codebase should be able to adopt Niku effortlessly.

Niku also supports Flutter 2 with sound null-safety and using Flutter 2 as a minimum requirement for composing an app with Niku.

## Adding to pubspec
Like every dependency, add Niku to "pubspec.yaml" and it should work out of a box.
```yaml
# pubspec.yaml
# ...
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  # ...others dependencies
  niku: # Use the latest version
# ...
```

Finally, download Niku to your codebase with `pub get`:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

Now you're ready to use Niku in your codebase.
