# Reusable Style
One of the most convenient benefits of Niku is,  you can create reusable styles anywhere in your codebase.

If you come from a web background, this is like a CSS class.
If you have some SwiftUI background, this is exactly like a custom modifier.

This is an inspiration to create Niku in the first place.
To be able to reuse styling anywhere not limited to a single codebase.

## apply()
For style builder, there's `apply()` which takes another instance itself and extracts and inherits the styling.
```dart
final title = NikuText()
  ..color(Colors.blue);

return NikuText("Hello World")
  ..apply(title)
```

You can also add more styling property after apply the styling.
```dart
final title = NikuText()
  ..color(Colors.blue);

return NikuText("Hello World")
  ..apply(title)
  ..fontSize(21);
```

## Multuple Styling
You can also apply multiple styling
```dart
final title = NikuText()
  ..color(Colors.blue)
  ..fontSize(21);

final bold = NikuText()
  ..bold();

return NikuText("Hello World")
  ..apply(title)
  ..apply(bold);
```

## Limitation
Although apply will inherits the style, it won't inherit the parent widget and it only accepts an instance of itself.

For Parent Builder, you can use the `builder()` method to compose multiple parents and reuse it instead.
