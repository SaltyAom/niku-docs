# Property Builder
Niku uses property builder to compose UI in Flutter as the following:
```dart
Text("Hello World")
  .asNiku()
  .color(Colors.blue)
  .bold();
```

Niku read from top-to-bottom instead of inside-out.

## Order
The order of property is important.
Each method uses to overwrite the internal style property of the widget in order.
If the property were called multiple times, Niku will use the last property and overwrite the previous one.
```dart
// Will display as red.
Text()
  .asNiku()
  .color(Colors.blue)
  .color(Colors.red);
```

## Transformation between type
As Niku's property use to mutate internal property, you can use cascade notation where transforming between type is not need.
```dart
// Valid
Text()
  .asNiku()   // Using text property builder
  ..color(Colors.blue)
  ..fontSize(21);

// Valid
Text()
  .niku()     // Wrap with Niku(Text())
  .p(24);

// Invalid
Text()
  .asNiku()   // Using text property builder
  ..color(Colors.blue)
  ..niku()    // Invalid, dot cascade don't transform type
  ..p(20);
```

In case which you want to use property builder with parent builder, you can either wrap dot cascade in parenthesis or use dot notation instead.

## Dot cascade
Dot cascade in Dart uses `..` instead of setting property one by one but doesn't support transformation between types.

As a workaround, you can wrap parenthesis to be able to transform into another type.
```dart
// Invalid
(Text()
  .asNiku()   // Using text property builder
  ..color(Colors.blue))
  .niku()      // Using parent builder
  ..p(20);
```

But this approach will wrap the widget in parenthesis where might be annoying.

## Dot Notation
Instead of using dot cascade, dot notation allows developers to transform between types.
```dart
Text()
  .asNiku()
  .color(Colors.blue))
  .niku()
  .p(20);
```

If the property type doesn't change, you can also use dot cascade in the parent's builder.
```dart
Text()
  .asNiku()
  .color(Colors.blue))
  .niku()
  ..p(20);
```
