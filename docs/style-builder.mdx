# Style Builder
Property builder uses to compose styling on each predefined widget and only exists on some like `Text`, `TextButton`, or `TextField`.

## Predefined Widget
To use property builder, you have to use a predefined Widget.
```dart
NikuText("Hello World")
  ..color(Colors.blue)
  ..fontSize(21);
```

Having multiple predefined Widgets in the codebase might lead to confusion, as to read the widget type, you've to read the word "Niku" first.

## As Niku
Niku solves this by providing an extension `.asNiku()` on widgets which has the same type as a predefined Widgets.
```dart
Text("Hello World")
  .asNiku()
  ..color(Colors.blue)
  ..fontSize(21);
```

Note: Using `.asNiku()` won't import property from a widget, will return a new instance of predefined Widget, import only required property instead.

For example:
```dart
// Won't import "fontSize"
Text("Hello World", fontSize: 21)
  .asNiku()
  ..color(Colors.blue);

// Above code will return this instance
NikuText("Hello World")
  ..color(Colors.blue);
```


## Parent Builder
After finishing composing styles property, you can also call parent builder.
```dart
Text("Hello World")
  .asNiku()
  .fontSize(21)
  .color(Colors.white)
  .niku()
  .bg(Colors.blue);
```

## Niku Core
Every predefined property extends `NikuCore` class which contains useful additional property like margin.

This means every property Niku property can call margin without transforming itself into a parent builder but will transform into `NikuCore` instead.

It's recommended to called margin the last property when using style builder because it'll transform itself Core itself which doesn't have any style builder.
```dart
Text()
  .asNiku()
  .color(Colors.blue)
  .fontSize(21)
  .m(20);
```

## Internal Mutation
As NikuCore extends `Widget`, it can also call `.niku()` to use parent builder.
```dart
Text()
  .asNiku()
  .color(Colors.white)
  .fontSize(21)
  .m(20)
  .niku()
  .bg(Color.blue);
```

Unlike property builder, NikuCore doesn't stack Widget, instead, it uses internal property mutation.
This means if you call multiple margins, it'll result in only a single margin instead.
