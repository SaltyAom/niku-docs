# Overview
Niku uses property builder to compose UI in Flutter as the following:
```dart
Text("Hello World")
  .asNiku()
  .color(Colors.blue)
  .bold()
```

There are two types of property builder in Niku
  
1) Style Builder 
  
2) Parent Builder

## Style Builder
Style Property builder uses to compose styling on each predefined widget and only exists on some like `Text`, `TextButton`, or `TextField`.

To use property builder, you have to use a predefined Widget.
```dart
NikuText("Hello World")
  ..color(Colors.blue)
  ..fontSize(21);
```

However, you can also use `.asNiku()` on widgets which has the same type as a predefined Widgets.
```dart
Text("Hello World")
  .asNiku()
  ..color(Colors.blue)
  ..fontSize(21);
```

## Parent Builder
Parent Property Builder uses to compose parent widget on where the method is called.
Wrapping the widget inside the property builder as a result.

Unlike style builder, parent builder can be called on any widget which extends `Widget`.

To use parent builder, simply call `.niku()`.
```dart
Text("Hello World")
  .niku()
  ..bg(Colors.blue);
```
Above code will return nested widget in traditional Flutter:
```dart
ColoredBox(
  color: Colors.blue,
  child: Text("Hello World"),
);
```
