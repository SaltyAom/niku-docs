# Overview
Niku comes from the Japanese word "Niku" (肉) means "meat" which I originally intended to plays with the word "Yakiniku" (焼肉).
Yakiniku is a Japanese-style BBQ.
The person will put bite-sized meat over a flame, flipping meat to grill it until desired.

Niku is also like that. 
You put a slice of meat (Widget), grill it with fire (property builder) until desired, and flip (switch between builder) to grill the other side and eat (build).

## Example
Niku uses property builder to compose UI in Flutter as the following:
```dart
Text("Hello World")
  .asNiku()
  .color(Colors.blue)
  .bold()
```

There are two types of property builder in Niku
Style Builder
Parent Builder

## Style Builder
Style Property builder uses to compose styling on each predefined widget and only exists on some like `Text`, `TextButton`, or `TextField`.

To use property builder, you have to use a predefined Widget.
```dart
NikuText("Hello World")
  ..color(Colors.blue)
  ..fontSize(21);
```

However, you can also use `.asNiku()` on widgets which has the same type as a predefined Widgets.
```dart
Text("Hello World")
  .asNiku()
  ..color(Colors.blue)
  ..fontSize(21);
```

## Parent Builder
Parent Property Builder uses to compose parent widget on where the method is called.
Wrapping the widget inside the property builder as a result.

Unlike style builder, parent builder can be called on any widget which extends `Widget`.

To use parent builder, simply call `.niku()`.
```dart
Text("Hello World")
  .niku()
  ..bg(Colors.blue);
```
Above code will return nested widget in traditional Flutter:
```dart
ColoredBox(
  color: Colors.blue,
  child: Text("Hello World"),
);
```
