# Builder
Parent builder only has a limited set of predefined widgets, sometimes you want to go beyond that or using a custom widget with Niku.

With `builder()` you can wrap any widget as a parent using Parent Builder.
```dart
Niku()
  ..size(100, 100)
  ..builder((child) => CustomWidget(child: child))
```
Just like any `builder` method, the builder takes Function with a child as a parameter, returning the current instance of the widget and return your custom widget as need.

## Reusability
You can create a function that returns any widget and reuse it anywhere just like apply().
```dart
final card = (Widget child) => CustomCard(child: child)

Niku()
  ..size(100, 100)
  ..builder(card)
```

## Factory
Or creating a factory function to providing a property.
```dart
final card = ({ 
  double width,
}) => (Widget child) 
    => CustomCard(child: child, width);

Niku()
  ..size(100, 100)
  ..builder(card(100))
```

Now you can compose any 3rd widget or create custom parent builder property and seamlessly apply it to Niku.
