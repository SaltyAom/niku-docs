# Naming Convention
Niku is inspired by SwiftUI and TailwindCSS.
Property builder approach from SwiftUI and Naming Convention heavily inspired by TailwindCSS.

## Tailwind
Niku use shorten idea from Tailwind and directly port most of the naming convention from Tailwind to Niku.

For example 
- `margin` as `m`
- `margin-left` as `ml`
- `border` as `b`
- `border width` as `bw`

However, Niku also trying to match to idiomatic Flutter and dart for example:
- builder
- animatedBuilder
- singleChildScrollView

Niku also uses some shorten name a `scrollable` as a reduced form of `singleChildScrollView`.

Mostly if you don't know which widget is available, you can try using full name to see if autocomplete is suggested.
