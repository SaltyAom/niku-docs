# Parent Builder
Parent Property Builder uses to compose parent widget on where the method is called.
Wrapping the widget inside the property builder as a result.

To use parent builder, simply call `.niku()`.
```dart
Text("Hello World")
  .niku()
  ..bg(Colors.blue);
```
Above code will return nested widget in traditional Flutter:
```dart
ColoredBox(
  color: Colors.blue,
  child: Text("Hello World"),
);
```

Unlike style builder, parent builder can be called on any widget which extends `Widget`.

## Internal Mutation
While the method is called, Niku doesn't create a new instance of Widget and stack the widget.
Instead, it uses mutate one single internal property instead of spawning a new instance and wrap it with Niku to reuse property.
This reduces unnecessary widgets from being build.

When the widget has to build, the internal property will be return and create a widget at the build method.

## Predefined Widget
If you want to create Parent Builder without a child, you can use the predefined `Niku()` widget instead.
This widget will take `SizedBox.shrink()` which has a size of 0 as a child instead.

```dart
Niku()
  .size(100, 100)
  .bg(Colors.blue)
```

You can also wrap a child in Niku widget which results in the same as calling `.niku()`
```dart
Niku(
  Text("Hello World")
)
  .bg(Colors.blue);
```
